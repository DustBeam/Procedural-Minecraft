# Procedural Minecraft Things With AHK & FAWE
<p>This method of procedural generation in Minecraft requires you to do a few things to get started.</p>
<p>First, you need to have access to a server with Fast Async World Edit intalled. This can be a locally hosted server, or one from a server host such as Minehut or Aternos.</p>
<p>Secondly, you will need Auto Hotkey installed.</p>
<p>Once you have those two prerequisites, download whichever AHK script you want from this repository, and run it with AHK.</p>
<p>Select the area you want the script to effect with //pos1 and //pos2.</p>
<p>Make sure your 't' keybind is set to open chat in game, not command. </p>
<p>Once you're ready to run the program, close your chat and press ctrl m.</p>
<p>DO NOT DO ANYTHING ON THE SAME COMPUTER UNTIL THE PROJECT IS DONE RUNNING!!! This will break everything.</p>
<p>You can tell the program is done when the chat box closes.</p>
<p>If you want to stop it, you will need to stop the AHK script as you would normally. Note that this will not pause it, so if you want to restart, you'll have to select a different area (or undo everything with '//undo <number>' and reselect the same area).</p>
<p>Happy generating!</p>
